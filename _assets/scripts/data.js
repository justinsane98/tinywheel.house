Our rig is a 2014 Fleetwood Bounder Classic 36H and her name is Mac. She’s 37.7 feet long, tows an Acme Tow Dolly, which our 2014 Fiat, Fifi, rides on. We have a Ford 6.8L Triton V10 gas engine.</p><p>Both the driver and co-pilot’s chairs swivel around to offer extra seating and open the space up to feel more home-like. All seats are made of faux leather. The couch and dinette both convert to sleeping areas; the couch open up to a full size bed with an air mattress topper, and the dinette table folds down to have a sleeping spot large enough for a child or two to sleep. we’ve never used them for more than a family movie night or afternoon nap.</p><img src="https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xtp1/t51.2885-15/e35/12071140_900386743379039_228600832_n.jpg" alt="Interior"><p>In the kitchen, Justin has installed a new faucet arched enough to fill stock pots. We use an Ikea dish drying rack that scissors flat for easy storage. We use regular ceramic dinner plates and bowls, and when we’re driving, layer the ceramics with ShamWow TM towels to dampen the rattle. All of our cups and glasses are either heavy duty ceramic or plastic. Our fridge runs on a minimal amount of propane or electric, ideal for us when boondocking.</p><img src="https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfp1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/11910170_439922829526474_366932709_n.jpg" alt="Mollys Room"><p>Behind the living area is Molly’s bunkbeds and the half bath we have converted into a laundry room. Molly sleeps on the bottom bunk at night, and we use the top bunk to store her clothes, diapers, books, and have a changing station. Molly also keeps her stuffed animals on her bed, in addition to extra blankets for those cold nights! In the now laundry room (formerly ½ bath), we have a 2100XC Splendide washer/dryer combo unit. It takes about 3-4 hours to wash a dry a really dirty load. We kept the toilet installed for those bathroom emergencies.</p><p>Next to Molly’s bedroom area is the Master Bedroom, where Anne and Justin sleep. We have a king size bed (in width but 6 inches short) with a 3” memory foam topper; the mattress from Fleetwood is just plain uncomfortable. There’s underbed storage, a wardrobe, 5 drawers, and overbed storage where we store almost all our clothes, sheets, and blankets. We also have a 27” TV that we’ve hooked up our WiiU to play Mario Kart.</p><p>At the back of the RV is our main bathroom. Shower, toilet, and sink, being at the back we have a slightly-larger-than-usual-for-an-RV shower that we have installed a cut off valve on the shower head. Seeing as our hot water heater is 6 gallons, one of us easily runs out of hot water long before finishing a shower if it didn’t have a cutoff. Cold showers in the winter suck!</p><p>On our tow hitch, we have a dual receiver so we can carry bikes outside the RV while towing the car. We have an adjustable drop hitch to get the 5 1/4” drop we need for the ball hitch to receive the tow dolly. We use an Acme EZETOW dolly with surge disk brakes.</p><img src="https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xft1/t51.2885-15/e15/11350770_1443149529322453_100976224_n.jpg" alt="RV Exterior"><p>Under the RV we have tons of extra storage. We call this our basement, and in there you would find everything you would in a normal basement or garage. Toys, fishing gear, snow gear, Anne’s extra crafting stuff, extra board games, and so on. We also have access to our black/grey water tanks, shore power, generator, and propane tank in our basement area. We have pass-through storage in a few bays, making it useful to store extra long items like ladders and brooms.</p><p>Finally, what really gives our RV a spacious small home feeling are the three automatic powered slides in the living room and bedrooms. With them, we can go from about 100 square feet to about 250 square feet, really opening up the RV. Additionally, the electric awning just over the door and our outdoor rug give us a nice little lanai to take in those beautiful sunsets.</p><h2>Nitty Gritty Details</h2><ul><li>Length: 37’7”</li><li>Height: 12’</li><li>Width: 102”</li><li>Interior Height: 79”</li><li>Interior Width: 96”</li><li>Interior Storage: 134’ (cubic feet)</li><li>Exterior Storage: 180’ (cubic feet)</li><li>Grey Tank: 40 gal.</li><li>Black Tank: 30 gal.</li><li>Fresh Water Tank: 85 gal.</li><li>Propane Tank: 20 gal.</li><li>Water Heater: Tank 6 gal.</li><li class="spacer"></li><li>Engine: 6.8L Ford Triton V10</li><li>Transmission: 5 speed automatic w/overdrive</li><li>Torque: 457 lb-ft @ 3250 RPM</li><li>Horsepower: 362 Horsepower</li><li>Fuel Tank: 80 gal.</li><li>Wheelbase: 228"</li><li>GVWR: 22,000lbs</li><li>Front GAWR: 8,000lbs</li><li>Rear GAWR: 15,000lbs</li><li>GCWR: 26,000lbs</li><li>Hitch Rating Weight: 5,000lbs</li><li>Tongue Weight: 500lbs</li><li class="spacer"></li><li>Dual 11.0/13.5 Btu/h Ducted Air Conditioners</li><li>34,000 Btu/h Furnace</li><li>6-Gallon Quick-Recovery Water Heater w/Direct Spark Ignition</li><li>Battery Disconnect System</li><li>Halogen Lighting (partially upgraded compact fluorescents)</li><li>On-Demand Water Pump w/Filter</li><li>Livingroom 32" LED TV</li><li>Bedroom 27" LED TV</li><li>Dual Flat-Panel Monitors in Bunk Beds</li><li>King Bed</li><li class="spacer"></li><li>4-Point Automatic Levelers</li><li>5.5 kW EFI Onan® MicroQuiet Generator</li><li>50 Amp Service</li><li>Dual 6V Deep-Cycle 217 Amp Auxiliary Batteries</li><li>Exterior Wash Unit</li><li>Full Body Paint</li><li>Pass-Through Basement Storage w/Side-Swing Doors for Easy Access</li><li>Power Awning</li><li>Power/Heated Rear-View Mirrors</li><li>TV Antenna w/Signal Booster</li>'

Justin’s been designing and developing for the web for over 15 years. Most recently, he worked at Square, Inc doing front-end development in San Francisco. Passionate about boardgames, Justin’s favorite board game is Last Night on Earth, and he’s always looking for people for an impromptu gaming sesssion. Justin’s been to 49 of the 50 states and is really looking forward to finally visiting Alaska.\n\n <img src="https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xta1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/12063204_504637936383701_688845554_n.jpg" alt="Anne">\n Anne is a domestic CEO, mom, wife, crafter extraordinaire and content writer for tinywheel.house. When Anne isn’t busy writing posts about RV lifestyle or busy keeping Molly supercharged with toddler activities, she likes to relax by reading, sewing and crocheting. When roped into playing board games with Justin, she likes to dominate him on a game of Carson City or Manhattan Project. While not as well-traveled as Justin, Anne is very excited about our journey and can’t wait to see what individual beauty each state possesses! \n\n<img src="https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xta1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/12080447_1069838939702415_949383064_n.jpg" alt="Molly"/>\n Molly is a toddler who is built for tiny house living and really enjoys life on the road. Molly loves everything My Little Ponies; Rainbow Dash, no, Pinkie Pie, no, Twilight Sparkle… is her favorite today. When Molly isn’t busy waking up with the sun, she loves jumping in mud puddles, climbing everything, running at super sonic speed, swimming, singing, reading and collecting rocks. Molly has grand aspirations of being the only kindergartener in her class to have collected a rock from all 50 states.'

        'title': 'FAQs',
        'body': '<div class="question">What kind of engine do you have?</div><div class="answer">Gas powered 6.8L Ford Triton V10</div><div class="question">What do you tow with?</div><div class="answer">Acme EZE-TOW dolly pulls our 2014 Fiat 500L</div><div class="question">How’s towing the Fiat?</div><div class="answer">We hate it. It’s not designed for flat towing, so we had to get a tow dolly, which is just another set of headaches. We have yet to not be stressing about the tow dolly and car while we’re driving. It’s fallen off the dolly once, it’s hard to keep the current straps tight (we’re exploring alternatives), and someone (not naming names) drove the car up and over the dolly once too. </div><div class="question">What’s it like with a kid on the road?</div><div class="answer">It’s awesome! We love it, Molly loves it, it’s been an amazing decision! We’re showing her beautiful places across the country, meeting new people, and giving her a world education. Additionally, she gives us a good excuse to go to Walt Disney World (Anne’s never been)!</div><div class="question">Where does Molly sleep?</div><div class="answer">Molly sleeps on the lower bunk bed, every night. When we moved into the RV, we transitioned Molly from her crib to a “big kid bed”, and she has been sleeping in her bunk bed ever since. We store her clothes, books, and stuffed animals on the top bunk bed.</div><div class="question">Nice solar panel, does it run your whole RV?</div><div class="answer">While it keeps our batteries charged when we’re boondocking, we also try to conserve energy too. We only have 2 standard 6V deep cycle house batteries (~200 amp hours), so we can’t power that much. We use a Go Power 120 watt portable solar panel. </div><div class="question">How’s the internet?</div><div class="answer">It sucks! Wifi in RV parks is free, but usually beyond useless. We had an unlimited data plan from Omnilynx aka Verizon, but that program was closed down at the end of November 2015. We’ve switched over to the new Karma unlimited data plan, Karma Neverstop, more on that here… (insert link to karma information). We’re in the process of procuring another Verizon unlimited data plan from a friend or Ebay.</div><div class="question">How do you afford to RV full-time?</div><div class="answer">Justin picks up contract work as a webdesigner and we keep our costs down by watching our expenses. Anne is exploring options for remote working. We try to keep pay-to-park costs down by either boondocking a lot or getting out of season monthly rates at campgrounds.</div><div class="question">Are you homeschooling?</div>Well, Molly’s only 2, so not formally, but we are working daily on ABCs, 123s, colors, shapes, and geology (Molly really loves rocks!). We also aren’t planning on homeschooling at this time. Homeschooling is not something either of us foresee having the patience for. We plan to settle back down at an unknown location when it’s time for Molly to start kindergarten. That will be our next big adventure!<div class="question">How long do you plan to full-time?</div><div class="answer">Probably another 2-3 years, and then we’ll be settling down for Molly to go to school. We’ll keep the RV and still do a lot of traveling!</div><div class="question">What’s your favorite place you’ve camped?</div><div class="answer">This is like asking, “who’s your favorite best friend?”, we’ve camped in so many amazing places. And some not so amazing places, but our current favorite two places we’ve camped are Emma Wood State Beach in Southern California, and the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah.</div><div class="question">What made you choose to full-time RV?</div><div class="answer">Why not? We had always kicked around the idea of travelling the country in an RV when we retired. One day we actually looked at RV prices and realized we could do this now, before Molly started formal schooling. So we bit the bullet, got the financing, bought an RV, and hit the road. </div><div class="question">Why gas over diesel?</div><div class="answer">Gas RVs are cheaper, and there were more affordable options in gas RVs for us. We also wanted to buy new, not used.</div><div class="question">Gosh, don’t you find gas to be expensive?</div><div class="answer">Right now gas is fairly cheap. Additionally, we offset the price of gas by finding cheap or free camping, and by camping in one place for longer periods of time. Additionally, our solar panel helps us avoid running the generator as often.</div><div class="question">Do you use a carseat while you’re driving? Where does it go?</div><div class="answer">Yes, Molly rides in her carseat in the RV. We secure her carseat on the couch with a seat belt that is mounted to the steel frame. </div><div class="question">How does the 💩(poop) work?</div><div class="answer">We still use the factory installed toilets. Fun fact, marine and RV toilets use a flush lever on the bottom, which you push with your foot! Our main toilet is also a vacuum flush, and makes a lot of noise when it’s flushed, it sometimes frightens Molly. We’re still on the fence about getting a composting toilet for the amount of boondocking we do. </div><div class="question">Where do you put all your stuff?</div><div class="answer">Well, we downscaled enough for everything to fit in the RV. With some ongoing reorganization and purging we continue to make more room, and if we consolidated right, we could probably have an empty outside storage bay or two and a couple of empty storage cabinets inside. We try to put stuff we use occasionally in the outside storage, and our frequently used items inside. We also try to use digitized media as much as possible to save even more room. Our boardgame collection that we had a really hard time downsizing takes up the most room, between one storage bay and two inside cabinets.</div><div class="question">Where do you wash clothes?</div><div class="answer">We originally started out doing laundry in campground laundry rooms. It cost about $10 to run a week’s worth of laundry for a family of 3. After much begging, pleading, and grumbling by Anne, we bought an all-in-one washer/dryer and installed it in our half bath mid-coach. See more: (link to laundry room reno blog)</div><div class="question">Is your RV new?</div><div class="answer">Yes, we bought our RV new. Between renting many apartments and houses, owning a couple houses, buying both new and used cars, we decided that owning new would be what worked best for us. We got a great deal on our rig, as we bought it at the end of 2014, and it had been on the lot since 2013. The dealer was very eager to move it. </div><div class="question">How does it work in the winter?</div><div class="answer">Well, we haven’t done any serious winter camping yet. We try to choose places that stay above freezing, but do prefer cooler climates. When we do some winter/snow camping, we’ll totally write a blog about it and share what we learned. In the meantime, these people have done some serious winter camping and have some winterizing tips: (list the wynns and maybe another site)</div>'

          'description': 'Nope.\nOur power went out at 3am this morning so that extra space heater Justin got yesterday was useless. We were super low on propane so luckily we had plenty of gas to power our generator. Apparently only part of the rv park doesn\'t have power and the front-desk person had no real idea of what was going on. The roads are pretty nasty so we are going to hunker down and use the generator sparingly. \nWith that said, Molly\'s face says it all. We aren\'t the biggest fans of the cold and are debating on heading somewhere warmer as soon as the roads clear. \n#tinywheelhouse #toddler #toddlerlife #snow #snowbirds #visitnewmexico #newmexico #snowing #scarf #fulltimerv #fulltimefamily #ditchingsuburbia'

        'description': 'tinywheel.house - Arizona Edition\nWe’ve spent some time in Southern Arizona recently and felt it was time to put out our first state inspired logo variation. This version was greatly inspired by the Arizona state flag. The flag of Arizona consists of 13 rays of red and yellow on the top half, the colors of the flag of Spain, representing the 13 original states. The red and yellow also symbolize Arizona\'s picturesque sunsets. The copper star represents the copper mining industry in Arizona. The rest of the flag is colored blue, representing the Colorado River which spans most of the western border. We thought was quite fitting that we managed to visit a copper mine, the Colorado River, took in majestic sunsets all within our first two weeks visiting the state. The picture paired with the logo was taken at sunset at the Saguaro National Park, capturing the magical Arizona landscape and sunsets. \n#tinywheelhouse #logo #arizona #visitarizona #sunset #nomads #wanderlust #rv #fulltimefamily #fulltimerv #fulltimervliving #gorving'

This is the much smaller version of the quilt she\'s been working on in parallel for our bed. It turned out beautiful and came just in time for the cool nights we\'ve been having in New Mexico. Most of it was done in the RV but things weren\'t optimal due to things like not having a space large enough to lay it out or a dryer large enough to wash it. Regardless, Anne did a fantastic job and just can\'t wait for the big one on the bed! \n#tinywheelhouse #toddler #quilt #quilting #homemade #fulltimerv #fulltimers #fulltimefamily #polkadots #chevrons #paisley #stripes #gorving #xscapers #toddlerlife #rvlife #rvlifestyle #rvliving'

          'description': 'Tiny homemade biscuits from our tiny kitchen!\nThis morning Anne caught up on some much needed sleep while Molly and Justin made his infamous biscuits from scratch for breakfast. We had these little guys with some rather tasty lemon curd and our usual breakfast beverages of choice. \nThe \'recipe\' is a just the right mixture of flour, salt, baking powder, sugar and butter. Recipe is quotes because it\'s all about getting the right dough consistency and honestly I don\'t know exactly how much I use of each. I prefer to use the convection oven feature on our microwave versus our tiny gas oven. It\'s easier to use, cooks more evenly and much safer since the oven is at toddler level. \nSo here\'s tasty tasty proof that you can bake delicious food in a tiny house on wheels!\n\n#tinywheelhouse #tinyhouse #tiny #biscuit #hotbiscuit #madefromscratch #homecooking #motorhomecooking #baking #fulltimerv #gorving #fulltimefamily #rvlife #rvliving #rvlifestyle #nomad #nomadlife #rv #kitchen #rvkitchen'

          'description': 'Karma Neverstop\nAfter yesterday\'s bombshell email terminating our Omnilynx unlimited data plan... Karma announced a new unlimited plan called Neverstop. It\'s $50/month for unlimited data with speeds capped at 5mbps on the Sprint Network. We\'ve had Karma for a while and have found it extremely good when we can get service. It\'s definitely not going to help in those secluded boondocking spots but it should be pretty solid in any town large enough for a Walmart. Given the Omnilynx announcement we are on the lookout for more data providers and Karma will certainly be a part of our arsenal especially for $50/month. \n#tinywheelhouse #nomad #nomadlife #karma #wifi #internet #wanderlust #orange #fulltimerv #fulltimers #rv #rvlife #rvlifestyle #fulltimefamily #gorving #data #wanderlust #hotspot #homeiswhereyouparkit #ditchingsuburbia #omnilynx #sprint #unlimited #boondocking #drycamping'

          'description': 'tinywheel.house is coming fast!\nWe\'ve been working hard in Las Cruces, New Mexico for the past week coming up with a brand for our little adventure. So here it is! We are tinywheel.house. We live in a tiny house on wheels so we think it quite fitting.\n\nWe bought our rig in December of 2014, went fulltime in January of 2015 and have really been on the road since September of 2015. So why start a brand now? Recently we met several fulltimers in Albuquerque at the balloon fiesta. They all had catchy brands, websites and social media accounts. Way easier to remember tinywheel.house than @justinsane98 and @juniperchica on Instagram.\n\nAbout the current logo:\nThe outer shape is the state of New Mexico (where we are currently located). The colors are traditional New Mexican colors. The idea is to tweak the logo for each state as we pass through. At the end of our journey we hope to have a collection of 49... sorry Hawaii but our rig doesn\'t float or fly.\n\n#tinywheelhouse #gorving  #fulltime #fulltimerv #fulltimefamily #rv #rvlifestyle #rvliving  #ditchingsuburbia #nomads #nomad #nomadlife #nomadlifestyle #nomadliving #nomadic #nomadiclife #nomadiclifestyle #nomadicliving #glamping #boondocking #roadtrip #ontheroad #lifeontheroad #wanderlust #wandering #gypsies #nm #newmexico #branding'

          'title': 'Top 10 things we wish we would have known about RVing',
          'content': 'It’s been nearly a year since we started full timing in our 2014 Class A Fleetwood Bounder Classic, and upon reflection we have come up with our top 10 list we wish we had known before we started RVing. Hopefully someone will read this list before they start their incredible fulltime RV journey and they can avoid some of the newbie mistakes we made. So here’s the list: \n<ol><li>Finding campsites is hard! I spend around 30-60 minutes looking for a new campsite every time we move, even before I start calling around to see if parks have availability. I usually end up checking AllStays, Campendium, Harvest Hosts, and the Escapees Boondocking Guide when looking for a campsite. Even if we’re boondocking (camping without hookups), the search can take a while due to differing municipality laws.<li>Black/Grey Tanks aren’t that bad. Before we started living in our RV, we had never gone RVing. Yup, we were total RV virgins. All of our research on dumping lead us to think it was going to be a gross and disgusting chore to dump the tanks. Either we lucked out or we’re not that squeamish after all, but hooking up and unhooking the sewer hose isn’t any more gross than a diaper (but I still wash my hands with soap, water, and hand sanitizer after doing the hookups).</li><li>Gassing up sucks. Our gas tank is at the rear of the RV, behind the license plate. RVs make getting in and out of gas stations a tricky dance. Driving a big vehicle also makes trying to line up the tank with the hose is difficult when it’s 37 feet behind you. Once we added towing our Fiat, gas stations got more convoluted because we can’t back up while towing. We try to be quick and courteous, but we’ve been yelled at by a sports car driver and nearly gotten stuck trying to get out of gas stations with narrow fill-up areas. We’d totally be down to use the trucker pumps, but usually those pumps are solely diesel.</li><li>Traveling is cleaner and healthier. When we’re driving, we don’t stop for drive-thrus or grab food convenience store food; we just eat the food we have in the fridge. We also get to avoid using the gross bathrooms at rest areas and gas stations! We’re also cutting down contact with other people and reducing our chances of catching a cold. Cleaning the RV is also way faster than cleaning any house we’re ever lived in due to the small space.</li><li>There’s ups and downs to living in a small space. Some of the ups: the toddler is never far, we can easily talk to each other across the RV, we don’t have a lot of junk cluttering up space, we buy less, and we plan our meals better because we don’t have a lot of space. Some of the downs: it’s hard to get individual space, you have to find just the right place for everything to go, the bathroom is small, and it’s easy to bonk your head on the overhead cabinets (or everywhere when you’re as tall as Justin!).</li><li>Storage hasn’t been an issue. We thought when we were downsizing everything we would have a hard time getting everything to fit in the RV. Well, we got it to all fit with some room to spare! Additionally, we’ve been able to get rid more stuff, giving us even more storage space.</li><li>Organizing takes a lot more work. RVs aren’t generally designed with fulltimers in mind, they are more designed for weekend/vacation use. There is never enough room in the kitchen for all the food and the dishes. We’ve rearranged the kitchen at least 3 times to maximize efficiency in the kitchen, and that’s probably not going to be the last time!</li><li>Raising a toddler in an RV is a lot easier than it sounds. When we moved in, Molly wasn’t yet 1 and a half, still very much a baby. I had to do very little babyproofing, as most everything is designed to be secured when the RV is driving, which also makes it hard for babies to get into drawers and fridges. Another upside about the small space is that it forces us to get out on adventures and we keep very few toys around. You really can raise kids anywhere.</li><li>Packing up to go somewhere new is so easy. Oh, we want to go camping this weekend? Lets think about about what we need to pack… oh wait, the house is already packed. :)</li><li>Internet is hard. Campground wifi is generally very bad. We’ve tried three different wireless hotspot providers- Karma (Sprint network), FreedomPop (Sprint Network), and OmniLynx (Verizon network). While this topic deserves it’s own blog post, the short of it is FreedomPop never works, Karma is great but still pay by the GB, and OmniLynx is everything we wanted except they aren’t selling new plans at the moment. On top of all that, Justin’s work depends on having a relatively good internet connection.</li><li>The list could go on, but 10 is such a nice round number! I know this is kind of short on how we do some things, but I promise I have longer, detailed blog posts coming on a few of the topics mentioned up above.</li></ol><p>Finally, if you’re looking into fulltiming or buying an RV, you must check out GoneWithTheWynns.com. We read/watched many of the videos and blogs the Wynns put together before and since we got on the road, and their advice helped us avoid a lot of newbie RV mistakes!</p>'

She seemed to understand and really went out of her way to avoid each different type of cacti we pointed out to her. Parenting win!\n\nThen comes moving day yesterday. We had just finished packing up and Justin was washing his hands when that sweet irony hit. Justin flicked his hands into the sink over Sir Richard Johnson III, our traveling cactus companion who rides in the sink when traveling. He just wanted to give him a little water but got 16 needles in his right hand in return... ouch. \n#tinywheelhouse #🌵 #cactus #cholla #saguaronationalpark #sharp #prickly #ouch #rvlife #rvliving #rvlifestyle #nomads #nomadlife #nomadliving #fulltimers #fulltimerv'

I have to be honest, I can\'t wait for cash only businesses to just go away... 2.75% is a reasonable cost of doing business and if you your business can\'t survive with that cost then it probably isn\'t a good business model to begin with.

          'description': 'New Mexico \'Highway\' 52...\nSo after leaving the VLA we decided to take the scenic and more direct route to Truth or Consequences and not backtrack through Soccoro. Boy was that a bad call... 60 miles of dirt, gravel and rock. It was like driving on the washboard abs of satan himself. So you ask, \'Hey Justin, why didn\'t you turn around?\' Well, that\'s the joy of driving a 37 foot long vehicle in addition to towing a car. We can\'t just turn around on a 1 and a half lane road with very soft and sketchy shoulders. We drove over 20 miles before there was even a place that I could think about turning around but I still didn\'t want to chance it. I\'d rather drive a shitty road than get stuck on the side of one. So I\'m not exactly sure what we could have done to avoid this because it\'s not like you could tell on the map it was a bad road. It\'s really tough to tell the difference even in satellite view between a gravel and an old paved road. Oh well, we got to see some beautiful parts of New Mexico and came out relatively unscathed. We just rattled one of our bathroom fan knobs loose and have a rather dirty Fiat.\n\n#gorving #fulltimers #fulltimefamilies #roadtrip #nomads #newMexico #nm #visitnewmexico #highway #gravelroad #curvy'

But what most don\'t know is that the movie was a film adaptation of a book written by Carl Sagan and his wife. The VLA was featured throughout the movie and was apparently some of the toughest scenes to shoot because they had to film the dramatic moving antennae shots on NSF\'s schedule since it\'s a working laboratory. We didn\'t get to see the antenna move but there is a schedule posted on their website detailing large rearrangements.

          'description': 'It\'s not all fun and balloons...\nToday after we had packed everything up to leave, we had our first major mechanical issue with Mack our 2014 Fleetwood Bounder Classic RV. Our Kwikee step motor decided it was done retracting the steps. It would gladly extend the steps but it would make a horrendous noise when trying to retract. I lubed up everything really well but still no luck. I then removed the pin connecting the stair assembly to the motor and could easily manually retract. It was definitely the motor. \nWe called Camping World and they didn\'t have the part or the time to fix it today or any time in the near future. There happened to be a RV repair guy at the balloon fiesta so I thought I\'d give him a try as a long shot. Super nice couple Phil and Ann just happened to have a replacement motor in their truck! But alas Phil was booked for the next couple of days but he sold me the motor. And he took credit cards with Square! 😆\n\nI was able to remove the old motor and replace it with the shiny brand new one.

Here Justin details our experience in DIY stairs motor replacement:</p><p>It’s not all fun and balloons…</p><p>Today after we had packed everything up to leave, we had our first major mechanical issue with Mack our 2014 Fleetwood Bounder Classic RV. Our Kwikee step motor decided it was done retracting the steps. It would gladly extend the steps but it would make a horrendous noise when trying to retract. I lubed up everything really well but still no luck. I then removed the pin connecting the stair assembly to the motor and could easily manually retract. It was definitely the motor.</p><p>We called Camping World and they didn’t have the part or the time to fix it today or any time in the near future. There happened to be a RV repair guy at the balloon fiesta so I thought I’d give him a try as a long shot. Super nice couple Phil and Ann just happened to have a replacement motor in their truck! But alas Phil was booked for the next couple of days but he sold me the motor. And he took credit cards with Square! 😆</p><p>I was able to remove the old motor and replace it with the shiny brand new one.

Soooo many people out today. Massive crowds with the local schools closed so the kids could come out (aka so the general public could use the school buses for shuttles). Definitely enjoyed earlier in the week more because you could easily go from crew to crew and chat with them about their balloons. Also we could let Molly run around but today she was confined to her carrier strapped to dad.\n\n#abq #albuquerque #abqballoonfiesta #balloon #balloonfiesta #hotairballoon #rainbow #fire #bluesky'

We stayed over in Laramie for a couple of days to give it rest but yesterday we needed to push on to Denver.\n\nWhen we landed in Denver I googled for some local dispensaries to find something to ease my back pain. I ended up heading to a very nice dispensary appropriately called Medicine Man. It was extremely nice! Very clean, huge selection and knowledgable and friendly staff. It reminded me of walking into a high end boutique. I walked out with two 275mg Bang pure indica vaporizer cartridges with 62.75% THC for $90. 😳\n\nMy back is still tender but feels much better and it sure made playing Rocket League with my brother in law last night a lot of fun!\n\n#fulltimers #colorado #denver #cannibis #dispensary #marijuana #medicalmarijuana #green #greencross #gorving #milehigh #nomads'

          'description': 'Flaming Gorge, Wyoming\nWe\'ve spent he past couple of days boondocking in a gorgeous (pun intended) spot pretty far off the beaten path. Definitely the most intense driving we\'ve done in the rig by an order of magnitude. The \'road\' had holes the size of our Fiat and was angled at times where we found ourselves leaning from one side or the other to help distribute the weight so we wouldn\'t overturn. In hindsight the last part is absurd but I guess it\'s like leaning into turns when you play Mario Kart. \nOur spot was beautiful and we were surrounded nature. There were so many antelope, tiny chipmunks and mosquitos the size of our Fiat. The water was cold but that didn\'t stop the ladies from swimming multiple times. We really didn\'t see anyone except for the occasional boat passing by. This spot definitely is for the adventurous and those rigs with high ground clearance. But if you can make it there... you get views like this.\n\n#rvlife #gorving #rvliving #nomads #ditchingsuburbia #wyoming #boondocking #lake #sunset #flaminggorge #fulltimers #fulltimefamilies'

Not sure of where we stayed was 100% legal but there were 2 other RVs nearby that decided to join us for the evening. I kept saying to myself that it couldn\'t get any better and just kept getting better! \nWhen the sun finally went to bed we had a glorious view of the Milky Way. While my iPhone 6+ does awesome for 90% of the photos I want to take, it was pretty useless at capturing any galaxies!\n\nI told Anne this morning that this was hands down my favorite camping spot in all of our travels this far. If you\'re ever in Utah...

For some perspective, I took this shot from right below the ceiling (6\'8") standing in half-bath/laundry room and heavily edited. To the left is the sliding door to the living room and to the right is a sliding door to our bedroom.\n\nMolly takes most naps and sleeps every night in the bottom bunk. We close both sliding doors, draw her curtains, turn on the white noise and retire to the living room. When it\'s time for us to go to bed OR curses if you need to use the bathroom before bedtime we have to make the treacherous trip through both sliding doors while not waking up Molly. Definitely a negative for the floor plan we have and it essentially makes the 1/2 bath useless if someone is sleeping in the bunks. But when it comes down to it Molly loves her bunks and so do we but we wish they were BEHIND the 1/2 bath.\n\nOh yeah, can anyone spot something that doesn\'t quite belong?

          'content': '<p>Today (Sept. 12, 2015) started out on a bit of a high note. Molly slept until 7:45am, practically unheard of in our household. She usually wakes at 6:00-6:30am. After our nice little lie-in, we got up, Justin and I noticed it was very smokey outside from wildfires (#ButteFire & #ValleyFire) to the south and west of us. We put packing up in the fast lane so we can get out of dodge. Unfortunately, Lady Luck was not favoring us today.</p><p>After packing up, we try to back out of our nice narrow and bordered with boulders campsite. Did I mention we recently, in the past 3 days, picked up a tow dolly for the Fiat and are still learning the nuances of driving while towing? Yeah. So that complicated things. Justin is a awesome at driving the RV and awesome at towing from years of experience driving delivery vans and towing boats in the Low Country, but this is kind of different for us.</p><p>We ended up unhitching the car after trying to back the car/dolly/RV up and having no luck getting it all out without hitting rocks. Well, we hit one rock. Sorry rock. We unhitch the car, but not before I try to take Justin’s finger off a couple different ways. Today was my klutzy day. I shouldn’t have gotten out of bed today.</p><p>After we unhitched the car, we pulled out of the campsite, mapped directions to South Lake Tahoe and searched for a nice flat straightaway to reattach the car to the dolly. As we are hooking the car back up, I’m trying to figure out how to lock the Fiat’s steering column so the wheels don’t turn while we drive and I’m still screwing things up. This is one of those times where I should’ve gone and sat in the RV so I wouldn’t take off my husband’s hand. Spoiler alert, I didn’t amputate his hand, but it was a close thing.</p><p>The car gets hitched up and we start driving, all of us, in the RV, YAY! Except not yay, the road is a paved logging road with massive potholes, bumps, and washed out shoulders. I think we were lucky there weren’t washed out stretches or joggers on the road. Finally, we got down the mountain to highway 50 and couldn’t turn left because it’s bikers weekend in South Lake Tahoe and there’s a million bikes headed our direction and no break in traffic. We’re slow. We can’t just zip out in any break in traffic and make it, it’s got to be a good long stretch of free road so we don’t cause an accident.</p><p>We finally found the break we needed, got on the highway, and headed towards South Lake Tahoe. Traffic is traffic, Justin is the bomb for driving our crazy train. I call and made us reservations at Tahoe Valley Campground, and all is good. Too good…</p><p>As we’re pulling off highway 50 onto Road C (a residential road into the RV park) it happens. We’ve driven 30 miles of climbing and descending roads, had several thousand feet of elevation change, transversed switchbacks and bumpy roads, dealt with stop and go traffic on a descent into South Lake Tahoe. We round this turn, and as we do we hear this squealing noise, a clunk, and then double squealing noise. Yup, the car fell off the Mother Fucking dolly. We stopped. In the middle of the road, blocking all the traffic, because the wheels are dragging (locked in park per owners manual recommendations). Thankfully people stopped to help us out since we were right outside the campground’s gate, and our breakaway chain kept the car from falling off in the middle of the road and being left behind. I hate the dolly now. Justin got the car unhitched again, and there was no damage to the structure of the car. Our stress levels have been sky-high today. It’s been an adventure.</p><p>But WE’RE STILL HERE!</p>'

I really need to adjust my braking style because our brakes got super soft on our decent towards the lake. We stopped off on the side of the road for a while to let them cool down. Also being 36\' long on a road that has a 39\' length restriction is really really hard. Next time we will take the longer safer route for sure. Lastly, notice our new windbell in the foreground! It\'s sounds more like a buoy bell more than a windchime. Very relaxing. Nice to have something familiar not matter where you travel. #fleetwood #bounder #rv #rving #camping #fulltimerv #fulltimers #fulltimer #ditchingsuburbia'

          'title': 'How to baby proof an RV',
          'content': '<p>When we first decided to commit to full timing, one of the topics I most searched for was tips to baby proof an RV. Sadly, there’s not a lot out there. Probably because RV’s kind of come pretty baby proofed because the have to go down the road and not have doors flying open! Here are some of my tips (sans bed information because I’m going to write an entire post about that!):</p><ol><li>Put chemicals for cleaning and the black tanks in an outside compartment area that locks.</li><li>We got a handy strong magnet rail from ikea to store knives on. We mounted it to the inside of an upper cabinet out of easy reach.</li><li>Make sure your refrigerator locks. If it isn’t built in, consider getting a door lock anyways for the fridge that adheres on. (Like this: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007A2ZSZ8/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_QJR4ub011THTJ">Munchkin Xtraguard Dual Action Multi Use Latches, 2 Count</a>)</li><li>Tension rods are great movable baby proof tools that have a ton of uses. Window lock. Sliding door lock. Lock books into place on a book shelf. Put across the face of an open shelf space to keep things from easily sliding off.</li><li>A large piece of cardboard or a plastic lid to a storage box has kept our uber curious 18 month old out from messing with the gas/brake pedals.</li><li>If you have a oven, an oven child safety lock is a nice thing. Remove the knobs from your gas stove, most knobs pop off most stoves. If not, there are knob covers that can prevent your child from messing with the knobs.</li><li>Bathroom- you can also use the locks mentioned above for toilets. We just keep the door closed or blocked if it’s a sliding door.</li></ol><p>That’s all I’ve got for now. It’s kind of hard for a little person to get into something their not supposed to because they are constantly supervised in the RV (aka can’t really get out of your line of sight). Soon I’ll post about our bedtime adventures and advice for that! It’s a doozy!</p>'

          'content': '<h2 class="subtitle">on the Sunny Side of the Golden Gate</h2><p>Ah, Marin County… full of wine, hipsters, retirees, hippies, yuppies, and generally everything expensive about the Bay Area. It’s an interesting place, not at all like the East Bay or San Francisco. Expansive mountains, slow flowing marshes, and iconic San Quentin Prison, Marin RV Park is full of views (I actually think San Quentin is quite architecturally significant and not super prison-y to look at).</p><p>Marin RV Park is close to many kinds of public transit into San Francisco, because let’s face it, you’ll want to visit SF if you stay here. First off the boat, one public transit option is taking the Ferry into San Francisco. Hundreds of Bay Area residents use the ferry system every day to commute to and from work. The walk from Marin RV Park to the Larkspur Ferry is about 15-20 minutes (plus a bridge cardio workout!). Use a clipper card to board the ferry and you’re good to go. The ferry goes past views of the Richmond, Golden Gate, and Bay bridges. On board the ferry sells snacks and beverages, including those adult beverages to help kick cocktail hour off right! In addition to the ferry, you can take the bus or drive into San Francisco. Besides driving, all public forms of transportation will either require considerable walking or a transfer once you are in San Francisco proper. In addition to visiting San Francisco, there are many hiking and biking opportunities in Marin County.</p><p>While the Marin RV Park is sort of plain, the park takes pride in their appearance. Grounds are always well-groomed, the laundry room is spotless, and the pool clean and clear. There’s also surveillance cameras on the property. Spots are relatively even and gravel parking. The staff is always generous in making sure your rig and toad have plenty of space to park and you most likely won’t encounter any nasty situations where you don’t fit in your spot. The internet works well 9-5 during the week, but slows down considerably during evenings and weekends.</p><p>Overall, we enjoyed staying at Marin RV Park and would definitely consider staying here again. I enthusiastically recommend them if transit time is not a major concern of yours and you’re willing to relax and enjoy the ride to San Francisco (or be like a true North Bay-er and drive in across the Golden Gate Bridge with all that crazy traffic).</p><p>Until next time, Sayonara San Francisco!</p><p>My thoughts and opinions are my own, and I have not been compensated in any way, shape or form to provide a review of Marin RV Park.</p>'

Laundry and pool on site. Quick walk to the Larkspur ferry and Trader Joes.</p><p>Where we ate: a lot at home, yay! We had breakfast at Rustic Bakery, Boudin SF, New Mexico kitchen in San Rafael, and Le Croissant in San Rafael. We had lunch at Cheesecake Factory and a random sushi place that was ok. We went out to dinner at Best Lil Porkhouse and Marin Brewing Company.</p><p>What we did: Justin commuted to San Francisco on the larkspur ferry- it goes past San Quentin, Richmond bridge, Oakland/Bay Bridge, Angel Island, with bonus views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. Molly and I frequently went to Alameda to visit friends, but we also went to the Bay Area Children’s Museum in Sausalito, Muir Woods (bonus- you can use your national parks pass to get in here), 3 different shopping centers, the Corte Madera Town Park Playground. We especially enjoyed hiking out to the lighthouse at Point Reyes and a remote trail that had a waterfall at the end.</p><p>Quick recap: there’s lots to do and see in Marin County, Marin RV Park is nice and clean, would recommend for a nice 2+ week visit. Live here? God, no!</p>'

The swimming pool is heated and the hot tub is warm for the cold and foggy days Pacifica is well known for. Travelling with little ones? There is a play structure on property for them to swing and slide when they get bored. Have you ever seen a whale? You’re in luck! During migration season, whale spouts are a common occurrence. Along with whales, avid wildlife watchers can catch glimpses of dolphins, pelicans, ravens, and the occasional whale carcass on the beaches of Pacifica. On an unusually clear and sunny day, ocean facing spots (there are a few) can see the Farallon Islands, container ships, sailboats, and sunsets.</p><p>The San Francisco RV Resort contains pull-thrus, back-in, long term, and dry camping spots. The waiting list is long for long term camping, so if you know you’re going to be in San Francisco for a while, plan ahead to get on the list in plenty of time. SF RV Resort is an Encore property so they give discounts for Thousand Trails members and Good Sam members too. This is also a popular spot with many foreign tourists, so plan ahead (a month or so) if you want to stay here for more than a night at a time, particularly during the summer months. Except for the dry camping spots, all spots have water, 20/30/50 amp, sewer, and cable hookups. The wifi is just about useless unless you’re on the office’s network. The grounds are very clean, laundry room is spectacularly clean, and the pool is always crystal clear and sparkling.</p><p>If you have a wider rig and slide outs, make sure to request staying in a pull-thru spots. They are more uniform in width, and while the sites are narrow, you’re most likely not going to be intruding on your neighbors spot.</p><p>All in all, we would stay here again. The public transit to downtown San Francisco is not bad (for not being in actual downtown SF…) and the views are amazing. The daily rate is comparable to the rent in the Bay Area- that is, freaking exorbitant. Hopefully next time we won’t be staying for 8 months, so it won’t hit our wallet nearly so hard. Until next time San Francisco, Sayonara!</p<p>All thoughts and opinions are my own, and I have not been compensated in any way shape or form for my review of San Francisco RV Resort.</p>'

          'content': '<p>Going minimalist is a pretty positive mindset for “holy crap I’m getting rid of everything I’ve owned for a significant part of my adult life, what am I thinking?!?!”. So to expediently get rid of everything we decided to have a yard sale in our apartment. Kind of like an estate sale, but very DIY.</p><p>Some pro-tips:</p><ol><li>lay out as much as you can the small stuff. Bundling tiny items together helps to move them out the door.</li><li>label label label! With the prices of course. Just go ahead and buy a giant pack of yard sale stickers!</li><li>don’t list your exact address on your announcements and advertisements for the sale. Use “corner of main and 1st, look for the sale signs” not “123 Main Street”. People like to get to sales early to get a jump on the garage sale and will knock on your door hours before the sale.</li><li>advertising on Craigslist, Facebook, word of mouth, and using signs got us plenty of buyers. Also use craigslist and Facebook to sell the bits that didn’t go at the sale.</li><li>have fun, and get someone to watch your kid!</li><li>get Square, accept credit cards for those high dollar items. Seriously. I don’t think we would have sold our $450 tv if we accepted cash.</li></ol><p>It took us about a week and a half to sell everything, and an entire day to move in. I think if we didn’t have a kid, it would have flowed faster, but a week’s still pretty quick!</p>'

We are in the middle of purchasing a new 2014 Bounder Classic bunkhouse model. I think we got a pretty sweet deal on the Bounder, as it’s the end 2014 and the 2016’s are about to start coming out next month, so we think the dealers are pretty eager to move these “old” models out the door! We’ve put a deposit down on it to reserve it, and since it’s in another state, Justin is going to fly out there and drive it back, if he approves of everything in the RV. I’m pretty freaking excited and hope we can be out of our rental by the end of January (it’s currently December). We’re waiting until we have the RV keys in our hands before we tell all our families, I’m pretty sure some of them are going to think we’re insane. Until next time…</p>'

          'title': 'The Plan- Financing!',
          'content': '<p>Since we want to be Fulltimers* it complicates things for getting a loan to buy an RV. I feel we are at the beginning of our journey into the world of getting a fulltimer RV loan due to the fact that banks are very reluctant to loan to people who can just move at will and easily disappear off the grid. Not that that is our plan! Because of the financially risky nature of fulltime RVers there are few lenders who will extend loans to individuals seeking to buy an RV to be their residence. Here is my experience trying to get an RV loan, where we went and what the process is like (this is not intended to be financial advice nor an endorsement for the loan providers mentioned below. I don’t receive any benefits from the following companies).</p><p>So when we first started looking for financing, it wasn’t as simple as getting a loan from one of our banks. Yes, we use multiple banks. All we kept reading about was Good Sam. They are apparently the number one name in Fulltimer RV and boat lending. They are also a part of Essex and Bank of the West. To apply for the loan with Good Sam (GS form here on out), you have to have an RV in mind that you’re going to purchase. We did our research and made a list of RVs that would work for us. When we applied for the loan we decided to put our top choice down, even though we were pretty sure it would be out of our range, because we thought, “hey if they don’t approve us for $X amount, surely they’ll tell us we can do something a bit lower”. We have high credit scores, great history, and Justin has a dependable high income. Apparently that wasn’t enough for GS. They also wanted recent comparable debt (like a mortgage) and thought our debt to income ratio would be too high after RV purchase (our monthly RV payments over 20 years would still be less than what we’re currently paying in rent in the Bay Area, but whatever). So they turned us down.</p><p>I went back to the drawing board to see if there was any other lender out there that wasn’t GS/Essex/Bank of the West. I found Alliant Credit Union, based out of Chicago, but with branches all over the US. We applied with them, they pre-approved us, it was a pretty easy process. For Fulltime RVers they want a bit of extra assurance you won’t bail on your loan payments, so they require a couple of extra contact (who aren’t on the loan), one years insurance premium to be held for 1 year, and 10-15% down on the loan. Not too bad! After being pre-approved for a reasonable amount, we found an RV within a couple of days, and hopefully we’ll be able to pick her up within a week (see next post)!</p><p>So I guess thats the gist of how we financed our RV. The story comes out much easier than the whole process was, and it has felt pretty dramatic! Read on for more adventures!</p><p>*Fulltimers are people who use their RV as their primary, or sole, residence.</p>'

          'content': '<p>Currently, we live in an apartment that used to be a single family house and has since had a building built beneath it. I call it our Frakenhouse, it’s a monster of 1890’s and 1970’s architecture, but at least its rode out 2 major earthquakes, so it’s got that going for it. Our apartment is 2 stories, 3 bed, 1.5 bath, with lots of room to spare.</p><p>The plan is to sell just about everything (all furniture, a load of clothes, appliances, etc.). So far I’ve been collecting and selling things piecemeal on facebook. We have a giant collection of boardgames that Justin has decided on half of which to sell. Currently I have 7 games I need to box up and mail to amazon so we can sell them on the amazon marketplace. I’m not complete in the process of selling things on amazon, but so far the process seems pretty easy. You sign up as a seller, upload your inventory (you can search and add to your inventory by UPC, which is fast and neat), decide on price, decide if you or amazon will fulfill the order. After you have created your inventory you create your shipment to amazon from your inventory, print labels, pack the box, and ship. I haven’t completely gone through the shipping to the amazon fulfillment center steps yet since it’s sunday, but plan to do that tomorrow or Tuesday when the library is open and I can use their printers. Once I’ve tested out the selling process to the point of getting it out of my house, I’ll probably be shipping 5-10 boxes to amazon, hopefully before christmas since it’s a major selling season ;)</p><p>Additionally, we’re trying to sell some of the smaller stuff on facebook in the various community groups set up for that sort of thing. I think when we’re closer to actually moving into the RV, we will have a do-it-yourself estate sale to sell furniture and whatnot. I’ve barely started selling, but so far it seems to be a good way to go. Back up plan is to hire someone to sell the crap for us, or just donate it all.</p><p>To help me get my head in the game and plan this massive massive purge, I’ve been reading up on tiny houses, lifestyle minimalists, home organizations tips. Pinterest has been a great help in finding me the resources to do such things. I’m still nervous about such a life change, but I’m excited to really live with just the things we need in just the right amount of space that we need.</p><p>As we keep downsizing, I’ll post more information, in case there’s those who want to follow in our footsteps, so to speak.</p>'
